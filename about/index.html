<div class="blurb">
	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>I've been "founded" in North-Brabant (Netherlands) and raised in Noord-Limburg (Netherlands)</p>
	<p>My interest in computers was sparked by my father who was one of the first in my environment to own a computer and modem. He used to build them and also program in DOS (We're talking Windows 3.1). Eventually as I grew older I found out about this language called HTML. In my youth I played with PHP and MySQL and got exposed more and more by Linux Servers, I also started managing a few and learning Linux Administration. My education had a Windows focus but I always loved the fact that you could just "make stuff happen by typing stuff", and so I fell in love with the Linux CLI.</p>
	<p>Over the years I developed a major skillset in Linux Administration, Python programming, Project management, Security and Process Analysis. I'm also very interested in how people interact with technology and am a very curious person by nature.</p>
	<p>For my career check my CV / Linkedin, but I worked for Nike, Mijndomein and Amazon in the past.</p>
